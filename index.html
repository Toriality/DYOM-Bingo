        <p>
          The game consists of a 5x5 Bingo card. You should mark a slot as
          completed when the content written on it happens during your play. For
          example, if you have a "Mission name is DYOM" slot and the name of the
          mission you are playing is "DYOM", you can mark the slot as completed
          by clicking on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first player who manages to mark 5 consecutive slots wins the
          match. The more players, the more fun and challenging the match will
          be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently the Bingo has 132 different slots that are randomly
          generated every time the page is reloaded. You can help increase the
          number of slots by contributing to the source code at the link above.

          Although the missions are randomly picked and you have no control over
          their content, this Bingo game still does not consist entirely of
          luck. There are a few techniques you can use to beat your opponents.
          Completing missions as quickly as possible so that you gain new
          content faster, or skipping missions that do not seem to have any
          content that exists in your Bingo slots are some possible techniques
          to beat the game before the other players.
