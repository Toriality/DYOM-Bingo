# Contributing Guidelines

We appreciate your interest in contributing to our **DYOM Bingo project**! To ensure a smooth collaboration, we have provided some guidelines for you to follow.

# Branches

In this project, we have multiple branches for different versions, except for the main branch, which is the official version of the site. However, the main branch **may not always be the most recent version**, as we are constantly adding new features.

To determine the latest version, **check the branches available in the repository**. For example, if we have branches `1.1`, `1.2`, and `1.3`, then `1.3` would be the most recent version.

Once a version has enough features and has undergone sufficient testing, it will be merged into the main branch and published on the official website.

# Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues with the project, please open a new issue on the Issues tab. When reporting the issue, provide a **detailed description of the problem, including steps to reproduce it**. 

Feature requests and ideas are also welcome in this project, so if you have any cool ideas, feel free to share with us!

Optional issue templates are provided to help you report the issue.


# Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to adhere to our Code of Conduct, which can be found in the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file located in the root directory of the project.
